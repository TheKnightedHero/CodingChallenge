# CodingChallenge

Purpose of the Application:

This project was built as a simple application, therefore it requires a java IDE to run it.
Simply load the porject file and run the program through the IDE

The application should: 

Take the given .csv file
parse the data
sort the data between completed fields and not completed fields
Export the two into separate files

-------------------
# Design Choice

I decided to write the application to run within a java IDE because my Java knowledge is limited,
having not been used in a couple years.
